    <p>     This is a Mean-Stack app created in a group of five using Scrum methodology. It is broken into three pieces; StatsDashbord, StudentDashboard and AdminDashboard. </p>
    <p>     StudentDashBoard is where students see todays curriculum, objectives, get help and see past questions. AdminDashboard is the mentors landing page, it handles attendance, managing the queue and initiating flash polls. The stats dashboard uses D3 and agChart to give mentors and teachers a visual synopsis of how students feel about their understanding of the objectives taught.</p>
    <p><em>AngularJS, NodeJS, ExpressJS, Material, D3JS, JavaScript, Mongo, Socket.io<em></p>
    <p>     It requires a DevMountain ID to work, so Video Walkthrough coming soon!</p>
