    <p>     A MEAN Stack Application. This was inspired by the first application I have ever made.</p>
    <p>     It creates a collection of classes for each user. Users can add/remove classes and students. Each student has attributes related to their abilities, the user selects the appropriate value for each characteristic. Upon submission, my API creates a report for each student and returns them. The reports are <em>never</em> the same and always accurate.</p>
    <p>     Payments are made possible by StripeJs and Passport</p>
      <p><em>AngularJS, NodeJS, ExpressJS, StripeJS, Passport, Mongoose, gulp, ES6, Sass<em></p>
