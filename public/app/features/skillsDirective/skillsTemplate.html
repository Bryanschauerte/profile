          Over the past 12 weeks I have been working hard at DevMountain. Each morning we have a lecture about a new technology, then work through a mini project. In the afternoon, each student has a larger project to work through on their own to really drive the knowledge home. All in all, its a good 8-10 hours a day. Check out my GitHub to get an idea of some of the challenges I've worked through

          <div class="card-content black-text">
            <span class="card-title black-text center-align"><b>Front End</b></span>
            <p>I have learned all sorts of exciting ways to manipulate the front-end using <span class="rotate rotateText">CSS, HTML, Sass, webpack, JQuery</span>.
            One of the most useful frameworks I've learned is AngularJS. Two-way binding and directives are the best parts.
          Recently, Ive discovered the joys of D3! And yes, of course one of the first thing I made was randomly colored/sized bouncing balls!</p>

            <p>Can't have the front-end with out the back! Some of the things I have experience with are <span class="rotate rotateText">NodeJS, MongoDB, Mongoose, ExpressJS, OAuth, PassportJS, FireBase, Socket.io</span>.
            Ah yes, cant forget about Javascript or Ruby!</p>
