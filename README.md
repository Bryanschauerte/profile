Welcome!
    Thank you for taking the time to look at my profile web application.
    
    It's front-end is based in AngularJS with materialize to help with the broad strokes of styling. I used NodeJS for my server and ExpressJS to serve up the app created with AngularJS. 
    
    In the Technologies section of the site you will find information about my time at DevMountain and some of the frameworks and libraries I am familiar with. The rotating text, listing various skills, was implimented by using simple-text-rotator found on npm. As for the bouncing balls, that was created by me using D3JS. Each ball is a random size, colored randomly and moving to a random location in the SVG container. 
    The projects section (currently), is two examples of personal projects I have created.
    
    Library browsing, the first project, is a live, Mean stack application. It's goal is to help users find their next book. It does that in a unique way. Users review books they have read and rate the amount (1-10) of certain charateristics are present in the book. The book reviews are all added to the mongoDb. When a user searches for a book, the engine takes a range of characteristics they enjoy and searches the database for similar books (within a user described range) and returns a list of choices and their description. 
    
    Restaurant Inventory is not live. Its goal is to allow restaurants to add items, by category, to their menu. It then keeps track of the ingredients in their store room and alerts the user to the availability of each menu item. The administrator can add new items with pictures, ingredients, price etc. It was my first project created on my own with AngularJS and Firebase.
    
    Coming soon will be an interactive user interface page that creates a bubble for each visitor. 
    
    Technology used in this app: AngularJS, NodeJS, ExpressJS, D3js and Materialize
